I completed Login and Register functionalities, session management using jwt tokens storing them in local storage 
login path=/login
register path=/register

I also completed upload of profile picture using multer in local storage in /uploads folder can view upload pictures
upload profile picture and details Bio,username path=/profileUpdate
I tried caching but couldnt get it to work as there is no redis version for my system

I added task management features, like add task , delete task , update task using express-router, ReactJs and Nodejs and mongodb to store tasks.
my approach is I created end points for each function and then using axios request we can reach those end points
